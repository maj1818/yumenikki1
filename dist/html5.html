   <br> <p class="Madotsuki" id="Hewwo2">Yume Nikki is a surrealist horror game made by the elusive developer, kikiyama; who ever since the release of the game in 2004 has not been seen or heard from on the internet ever again. Game made in Rpg maker, kikiyama crafted a perfect abstract telling of a real life mental disorder “Hikikomori” or shut-in where adults will shut themselves in and exclude outside social interactions. This game centers around Madotsuki, our main-protagonist who through going through her dreams you get to see her abstract but yet fascinating adventures. You go through rooms like a snow world where everything is covered in snow, or even graffiti world where it looks like myspace on steroids.  Feelings of solitude, self-discoverment, loneliness and fear are explored through this no-dialogue, vague task of a game. Through all the 12 locations you adventure through you will find an egg (effect) that if you equip by pressing f, you can see the effect (knife, long hair, bicycle) on Madotsuki. If you do collect all the effects, you go back to the main hall to see the ending once you put them down. The ending I will not spoil is a tragic ending to the wonderful weird game of Yume Nikki. On the next page I’ll be discussing my favorite rooms and my feelings towards them.

    <p class="abstract" id="Madotsuki2">My first favorite place when I first clicked that start game on the intro has to be the <p4 class="forest world">Forest World</p4> where the strange ambient alien music plays drearily in the background. Throughout the world, these squiggly multicolored creatures can be picked up and follow you around till you find the frog effect (your head is replaced by a frog head). The feelings I get from this room are uncomfortable but comfortable at the same time. It feels like I’m being watched but I don’t know if that’s a bad thing since I’m all alone in this maze of trees and unwavering creatures. The atmosphere and overall neverending trees sends shivers down your back when you spend more than a minute in there. <br> <p3 class="eyeball world">My other favorite place would have to be <p5 class="AAA">Eyeball world</p5>, where millions of eyes are peering up from the ground to stare at you eternally wherever you go. If you do happen to get the knife effect, you can attack the eyes and watch blood come out. When you walk around far enough, you begin to see disembodied limbs float or walk around. If you’re lucky enough, you can find a creature that if gets too close to you that they cause a game over where you wake up in your bed and start from one of your saves. My feelings however are a bit different from the way I describe the room, it’s oddly calming and I feel at peace staying in that room. The serene blue background and peaked alien music makes me happy. </p3> <br>
      <p7 class="sky garden">My all time favorite place of Yume Nikki, the place that disects my inner insecurities and makes me tear up when I visit, is <p8 class="SAD">Sky garden.</P8>The park at the top is my all time favorite place to visit in this game, the bench to the left, and the overhead view of the city below makes me wanna curl up in a blanket with some tea. But to go deep into the feelings evoked by the overhead where even though you’re surrounded by creatures, you still feel lonely, a deep bone-chilling loneliness that sucks the positive out of you and slowly infects each and every porous in your bones; to your twisted throat where words can’t be spoken but only tears can show. It feels empty, you feel everything but nothing at the same time, it’s a plethora of nothing emotions. But above all, the music fills me with comforting hope, that by the end of the game, I’m not destroyed by the ending.
